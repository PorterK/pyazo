# Pyazo
#### A screenshot application written in Python

##Why?
I am writing this application as a final project for CS230 (Computing I) at IUPUI. I felt that I should
create something that I am willing to show off outside of the classroom, hence this repo.

##Usage
Feel free to use the app, pick through the source, fork and modify.

Detailed usage to come, packaging may change in the near future

##Bugs
Please report any bugs to the GitHub Issues section-- not to me directly.

##Todo

- [x] Make the app skeleton
- [x] Add the graphical elements
- [x] Actually save images
- [ ] Create the backend API for image uploads
- [ ] Upload images to the backend
- [ ] Open image in the browser
